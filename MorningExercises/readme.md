I try to realize my idea for morning exercises.

You begin with 20 press-ups, 20 abs crunches, 20 squats. Three sets of such things.
Between every exercise 20 seconds rest. Between sets 40 seconds rest.
Every day you add one to everything but rest between sets. Here you add 2.
Maximum rest between exercises should be 60 seconds.
Maximum rest between sets should be 120 seconds.

At the page you input a date when you begin your trainings. Click on a button. A table with shedule appears.

Later I'll try make the page alive. With timer and colors and other cute things.
